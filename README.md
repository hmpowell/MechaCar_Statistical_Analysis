## Linear Regression to Predict MPG

![This is a picture showing the summary of a linear regression model](https://github.com/hmpowell/MechaCar_Statistical_Analysis/blob/main/linear_regression.png)

Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?
- Vehicle length, ground clearance, and the intercept provide non-random amounts of variance to the mpg values. The p-values for these variables are very very small which shows that it is statistically unlikely for them to provide random variance.

Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?
- The p-value for this model is very, very small; therefore, we know we can reject the null hypthesis that the slope is 0 (ie. there is no significant relationship between the dependent and independent variables).

Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?
- This model has an r-squared value of 0.7149, which means that around 71.5% of our data points fall in this model. It is not a perfect model; however, it will be accurate around 71.5% of the time, making it somewhat of an effective predictor.

## Summary Statistics on Suspension Coils

The design specifications for the MechaCar suspension coils dictate that the variance of the suspension coils must not exceed 100 pounds per square inch. Does the current manufacturing data meet this design specification for all manufacturing lots in total and each lot individually? Why or why not?

## Study Design: MechaCar vs Competition

Write a short description of a statistical study that can quantify how the MechaCar performs against the competition. In your study design, think critically about what metrics would be of interest to a consumer: for a few examples, cost, city or highway fuel efficiency, horse power, maintenance cost, or safety rating.

What metric or metrics are you going to test?
What is the null hypothesis or alternative hypothesis?
What statistical test would you use to test the hypothesis? And why?
What data is needed to run the statistical test?
